# Welcome to the Intelligent Bark Beetle Identifier (IBBI)

**IBBI** is a Python package that provides a simple and unified interface for detecting and classifying bark and ambrosia beetles from images using state-of-the-art computer vision models.

This package is designed to support entomological research by automating the laborious task of beetle identification, enabling high-throughput data analysis for ecological studies, pest management, and biodiversity monitoring.

### The Need for Automation

The accurate and timely identification of bark and ambrosia beetle species is fundamental to forest health monitoring. However, many species are morphologically similar, making identification a significant bottleneck that requires highly specialized taxonomic expertise. IBBI addresses this challenge by providing an accessible, programmatic solution that automates the identification process.

### Key Features

* **Simple API:** Access powerful detection and classification models with a single function call: `ibbi.create_model()`.
* **Multiple Model Types:**
    * **Single-Class Detection:** Detect the presence of any beetle in an image.
    * **Multi-Class Classification:** Identify the species of a beetle from a cropped image.
    * **Zero-Shot Detection:** Detect beetles using a text prompt, without prior training on that specific class.
* **Pre-trained Models:** Leverages pre-trained models hosted on the Hugging Face Hub for immediate use.
* **Model Explainability:** Understand model predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to visualize which parts of an image contribute to the identification.
* **Extensible:** Designed to easily incorporate new model architectures in the future.
* **Research-Focused:** Aims to accelerate ecological research by automating beetle identification.
